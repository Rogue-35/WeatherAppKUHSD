# KU High School Design Competition (Computer Science) - Weather Application

This project was developed for the KU High School Design Competition, where our team created a desktop weather application using Python. The application integrates the OpenMeteo Online weather API with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter and TK Modern themes, offering users historical weather data with a modern interface. Our project leverages REST API requests for data retrieval and Matplotlib for graphing, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. Our team was honored to receive first place at the competition for this innovative approach.

## Project Overview

This weather application enables users to access historical weather data and view it through real-time graphs. Using a variety of Python libraries, the application is designed for smooth data handling, a responsive interface, and robust backend functionality.

### Key Features

- **Historical Weather Data Access:** Connects to the OpenMeteo Online weather API to fetch historical weather information, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speeds for a specified location.
  
- **Modern User Interface:** Combines Tkinter with TK Modern Themes, presenting a polished and intuitive user interface. Users can easily input locations and retrieve detailed weather information.

- **Data Caching and Reliable Access:** Utilizes `requests_cache` to cache API responses, reducing redundant calls and improving efficiency. `retry_requests` is implemented to handle intermittent connectivity, providing a stable and consistent data experience.

- **Data Visualization with Matplotlib:** The application integrates Matplotlib to display weather data in visually accessible bar charts, with `FigureCanvasTkAgg` allowing the charts to be embedded directly in the Tkinter interface.

- **Enhanced Performance with Threading:** To improve responsiveness, background threads are used for data retrieval and API calls, preventing interface slowdowns during data processing.

- **System Resource Management with psutil:** The `psutil` library enables system resource monitoring, allowing the application to adjust operations based on resource availability for an optimized performance.

- **Flask-based API Layer:** A lightweight Flask API layer supports advanced interaction with the weather application, enabling RESTful requests and facilitating data exchange with external tools.

### Technology Stack

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `tkinter` and `ttk` for the core graphical interface
  - `TKinterModernThemes (TKMT)` for a modernized look and feel
  - `matplotlib` for plotting weather data
  - `requests_cache` for efficient data caching
  - `retry_requests` for request retry handling
  - `Flask` for creating a RESTful API
  - `psutil` for managing system resources

- **External API:**
  - **OpenMeteo Online Weather API** for historical weather data access

### Installation and Setup

To set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/weather-app
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   Ensure Python 3.12 or later is installed. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   Launch the application using:
   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

### Usage

Upon launching the application, users can:

- **Upload Data Files:** Example data files are included in the repository to demonstrate application functionality.
- **Enter a Location:** Fetch and display historical weather data for specific locations.
- **Visualize Data:** View graphs and charts generated by Matplotlib, enabling an intuitive look at weather trends.
- **Access Advanced Options:** Utilize caching, retry logic, and the built-in API layer via Flask for enhanced functionality and RESTful interaction.

### Code Structure

- **Main Application (`weather_app.py`):** Manages the primary UI, handles API calls, and facilitates data visualization.
- **Flask API Module:** Contains REST API endpoints for application interaction.
- **Data Cache Management:** Optimizes API data retrieval with `requests_cache`.
- **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Provides reliable operation, especially in fluctuating internet conditions.
